# React-Admin Overview

React-Admin is a frontend framework for building admin interfaces on top of REST/GraphQL/Custom backends. It uses MUI for UI components and is highly extensible.

## Key Concepts

- `Admin`: The root component
- `Resource`: Declares data entities like `users`, `posts`
- `List`, `Edit`, `Create`, `Show`: CRUD views for resources
- `Datagrid`, `SimpleForm`, `TextInput`, `SelectInput`: MUI-based input components
- `useDataProvider`, `useNotify`, `useRedirect`: React hooks to integrate backend/data workflows
- Themeing is handled with `@mui/material/styles`
- Authentication/authorization is plug-and-play using custom `authProvider`

## Styling

React-Admin themes are MUI themes. You can override global styles, fonts, colors, and component overrides through the theme passed into `<Admin>`.

## Layout

Custom layouts extend `Layout`, `AppBar`, `Menu`, `Dashboard` and are configurable.
